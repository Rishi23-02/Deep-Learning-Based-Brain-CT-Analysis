# Deep-Learning-Based-Brain-CT-Analysis
Leverages deep neural networks to automatically process, interpret, and derive insights from computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain. This technology represents a significant leap in neuroimaging, enabling faster, more accurate detection and classification of brain abnormalities while reducing the workload on radiologists.
# Dataset and Preprocessing
This project utilizes brain CT scan images for deep learning-based analysis of brain strokes. The original dataset, consisting of CT images annotated for stroke detection, is sourced from the following Kaggle repository:

Original Dataset: Brain Stroke CT Dataset by Özgür Aslan

Preprocessed Data: Preprocessed Brain CT Data by Rishitha R.
