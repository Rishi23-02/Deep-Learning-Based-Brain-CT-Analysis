# Deep-Learning-Based-Brain-CT-Analysis
Leverages deep neural networks to automatically process, interpret, and derive insights from computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain. This technology represents a significant leap in neuroimaging, enabling faster, more accurate detection and classification of brain abnormalities while reducing the workload on radiologists.
